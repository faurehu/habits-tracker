## Habits Tracker

Use Google Spreadsheets to program habits on different frequencies, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. This code will fetch your data and create items on your Todoist account.

Additionally, it also fetches your results from Todoist and stores the results in a different sheet.

I am deploying this as an AWS Lambda service, it'll trigger every evening.

If you want help to set this up for yourself, mail me at hi@faure.hu

### Motivation:
Todoist is a great To Do application and it supports iterative items but at the moment it is not possible to set reminders for every new iteration. I have been meaning to learn Go and play with AWS Lambdas so I decided this would be a fitting project.
